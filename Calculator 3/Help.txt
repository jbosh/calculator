Calculator by Jbosh 2.2.0.0 (jsbosh@gmail.com)

Hot Keys:
Ctrl + N: Creates a new instance of the current window.
Ctrl + M: Brings up the menu to spawn other solvers.
Ctrl + F: Same as Ctrl + M.
Ctrl + Q: Quits the entire application.
Ctrl + +: Adds a new text box to the calculator window.
Ctrl + -: Removes the last text box from the calculator window.
Ctrl + Shift + Del: Clear all fields in calculator.
Ctrl + S: Saves current calculator fields.
Ctrl + Shift + S: Save as.
Ctrl + O: Opens a txt file with calculator fields.
Click	: Clicking on an answer will copy the answer to the clipboard.
Esc		: Closes the current window.

F1		: Opens the help menu. 
F2		: Options menu.


Notes:
-NaN is the answer when there is a parsing error or you screwed up.
-Copy the answer to the clipboard by clicking on it.
-Use () or {} or [] for parenthesis.
-Commas are accpetable but do not affect the outcome
 Ex. 1,000,000 or 1,0000,00, are both considered to be 1000000.
-All calculator functions are in degrees.

Functions:
tan, sin, cos: find the trig values of numbers. Ex. sin(pi) or sin pi
atan, asin, acos: find the angle from a number. Ex. asin(1/2) or asin 2
tanh, sinh, cosh: hyperbolic trig. Ex. tanh(17) or sinh 2
deg, rad: converts a number to deg or to rad. Ex. deg(pi) = 180 or rad(180) = pi
sqrt: Takes the square root of a number.

abs: find the absolute value of a number.
%: find a number mod another. Ex. 10 % 3 = 1
!: factorial a number.  Works with positive integers only.
ln, log: natural log and log of a number.  Ex. ln 2 or log(10)

Variables:
e = 2.71828...: Euler's variable
pi = 3.141592...
g = gravity (m/(ss)) = 9.8, please note that it is positive.
c = speed of light (m/s)
G = 6.67428E-11: Gravitation constant.

Command Line Arguments:
-c: Opens the calculator first (this is default on).
-p: Opens to the physics solver.
-q: Opens to the quadratic formula.
-s: Calculator program will parse the given input and output the answer.

Future Releases:
-Hex numbers are supported, but not well.  Just throw a '0x' before 
 a number to have the calculator attempt. Ex. 0xff3 = 4083.
-Use {} for vectors. Ex. {2;3}.
	-dot: performs a dot product. Ex. 2<1;2>dot<0;1>
	-cross: perfroms cross product. Ex. 2<1;2;1>cross<0;1;2>
	 (Works in 3 dimensions only.)
	-normalize: normalizes the vector. Ex normalize<3;2>
-Ctrl + Enter inserts a line, Ctrl + X deletes a line.
